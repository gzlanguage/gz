    <h2>1. What is G-Z and what is it used for?</h2>
    <p>G-Z is a completely free web application that allows users to submit their date of birth, country of birth, and gender without prior registration. It is designed to generate global and national birth statistics, including:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Births by day, month, and year.</li>
        <li>Distribution by country, gender, and age.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The main objective is to provide accessible and anonymous demographic data to better understand global population trends. But G-Z is not just about statistics -- it also offers fun and engaging features to build a sense of community:</p>

    <h2>2. Is my data anonymous?</h2>
    <p>Yes, your data is completely anonymous. We designed G-Z to ensure that:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>No data can be traced back to an individual user.</li>
        <li>We do not collect any information that identifies who submitted what. Rest assured, your identity is protected and your data is immediately aggregated.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Why keep our access code?</h2>
    <p>Your access code grants you access to the G-Z mobile app — a platform far more ambitious than just a statistical tool.</p>
    <p>G-Z is built on three fundamental pillars:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Understand</strong>: By receiving real data (births, daily life, challenges faced...), G-Z offers a clear and human perspective on social realities worldwide.</li>
        <li><strong>Educate</strong>: These statistics enable everyone — young people, the curious, researchers — to learn, analyze, and reflect better on the issues of our time.</li>
        <li><strong>Act</strong>: G-Z is not here to observe, but to help. Through the collected data, NGOs, researchers, decision-makers, and engaged citizens can identify real problems and provide concrete, targeted, and effective solutions.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>G-Z transforms human experiences into responses. By keeping your access code, you participate in a project that connects those facing difficulties with those who want to solve them. A tool to understand the world, but above all, to change it.</p>
    <p>Your support is crucial for bringing the G-Z mobile app to life. To contribute to this project, click on the link below:</p>

    <h2>4. Can I modify or delete my submissions?</h2>
    <p>Yes, you have the option to delete your data immediately after submitting it. Here's how:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>A reset icon will appear after submission.</li>
        <li>By clicking on this icon, your data will be completely deleted from our servers.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>However, once you close the web application or the session expires, the data becomes irreversibly anonymized and can no longer be modified or deleted. Please refer to our <a href="Confidentialité.html">Privacy Policy '5'</a> for more information.</p>

    <h2>5. What happens if I provide incorrect information?</h2>
    <p>We encourage you to submit accurate and verified information to ensure the quality of the statistics. If you notice an error after submission:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Use the reset icon to delete your data.</li>
        <li>You can then submit the corrected information.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6. Why follow G-Z on social media?</h2>
    <p>By following us on social media, you can:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Stay informed about new analyses and demographic trends.</li>
        <li>Discover regular updates on our global statistics.</li>
        <li>Participate in educational discussions around global demographic data.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Additionally, we share fascinating information derived from our statistics, while keeping you informed about our new projects.</p>
