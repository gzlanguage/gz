    <h2>1. What is G-Z and what is it used for?</h2>
    <p>G-Z is a completely free web application that allows users to submit their date of birth, country of birth, and gender without prior registration. It is designed to generate global and national birth statistics, including:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Births by day, month, and year.</li>
        <li>Distribution by country, gender, and age.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The main objective is to provide accessible and anonymous demographic data to better understand global population trends. But G-Z is not just about statistics -- it also offers fun and engaging features to build a sense of community:</p>

    <h2>2. Is my data anonymous?</h2>
    <p>Yes, your data is completely anonymous. We designed G-Z to ensure that:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>No data can be traced back to an individual user.</li>
        <li>We do not collect any information that identifies who submitted what. Rest assured, your identity is protected and your data is immediately aggregated.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. About Our Discord Community</h2>
    <p>Join the G-Z community on Discord! We have already created servers and categories representing the 12 months of the year. Each month has its 31 days, with February having 29 days. Based on your birthday, if you were born in January (01), you can click on January and select your birth date (01 or 1) to join the server dedicated to individuals with the same birthday. This space allows you to connect and learn more about others who share your special day!</p>
    <p>It's important to read our rules to avoid any issues. Additionally, on our main page, there's a contact area where you can share your ideas for gamification and challenges between birthday groups. Your input is welcome!</p>

    <h2>4. Can I modify or delete my submissions?</h2>
    <p>Yes, you have the option to delete your data immediately after submitting it. Here's how:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>A reset icon will appear after submission.</li>
        <li>By clicking on this icon, your data will be completely deleted from our servers.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>However, once you close the web application or the session expires, the data becomes irreversibly anonymized and can no longer be modified or deleted. Please refer to our <a href="Confidentialité.html">Privacy Policy '5'</a> for more information.</p>

    <h2>5. What happens if I provide incorrect information?</h2>
    <p>We encourage you to submit accurate and verified information to ensure the quality of the statistics. If you notice an error after submission:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Use the reset icon to delete your data.</li>
        <li>You can then submit the corrected information.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6. Why follow G-Z on social media?</h2>
